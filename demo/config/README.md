# Config

This is the folder where all config files live.

Organize it however you want. My way is:

- **constants** Sets default lang, paths and urls.
- **locale** Sets locale configuration and default common dictionaries.
- **router** Sets default values for routes and their run options.
- **navigation** Sets navigation elements like main nav, asides...
- **all**. Include all previous and sets autoload method (composer|custom).
