# Demo application

**IN PROGRESS**. This is a growing list of samples for core and component libraries.

It is always easier to understand with a working demo. http://cdn.zentric.es/zentric/demo.

This folder  contains the sources for a full demo application with most of standar components which are clasified by subfolders:

- **config** all confguration files.
- **content** static contents.
- **locale** dictionary files for multilang support.
- **src** application scripts like controllers, utilities, etc.
- **templates** template files.
