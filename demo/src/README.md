# src

This is the folder where script files live.

You can clasify however you like. Use a MVC structure with controller, models and view scripts...or don't.

For autoload funcionality, script files must be named same as the class that is declared. So, for example, file `MyController.php` must contain code for `MyController` class:

```php
class MyController 
{
	// class methods
}
```
